Discription 
 1. Introduction
The purpose of this algorithm is to detect and count the number of bottles present in an image of a bottle crate.
The algorithm utilizes image processing techniques to isolate and identify circular objects representing bottles.
2 Image Preprocessing Step
• The algorithm begins by reading the input image of the bottle crate.
• If the image is in color, it is converted to grayscale for easier processing.
• Top-hat transform is applied to enhance the contrast of the grayscale image, particularly emphasizing bright
regions against a relatively dark background.
• The enhanced grayscale image is binarized using Otsu’s thresholding method to segment objects from the
background.
• Morphological closing operation is performed to smooth the binary image and fill in small gaps or holes within
the objects.
• A bounding box is defined to specify the region of interest (ROI) within the bottle crate area.
• A binary mask is created based on the bounding box to isolate the ROI from the rest of the image.
• The binary mask is applied to the binary image obtained from the previous step to extract the ROI.
3 Circle Detection using Hough Transform
• Hough transform is applied to detect circular objects within the ROI.
• Two separate rounds of circle detection are performed with different radius ranges:
– Detect the bottle cap.
– Detect the bottle bottom.
• Detected circle centers and radii are obtained from the Hough transform.
4 Post-processing
Detected circles are subjected to a post-processing step to remove or merge closely spaced circles, which may
represent overlapping circles or artifacts.
• A custom function merge or remove circles is implemented for this purpose.
• The function iterates through pairs of detected circles, calculates the distance between their centers, and
compares their radii.
• If the distance between two circles is below a predefined threshold, the circle with the larger radius is removed.
• This step helps in eliminating false detections and ensuring accurate counting.
5 Counting and Visualization
• The total number of circles (representing bottles) after post-processing is counted.
• Detected circles along with their counts are overlaid on the original grayscale image for visualization.
• The total count is displayed as text on the image for easy interpretation.
6 Conclusion
The algorithm effectively detects and counts the number of bottles present in the input image of a bottle crate.
By employing a combination of image preprocessing, circle detection using Hough transform, and post-processing
techniques, it achieves accurate and reliable bottle counting results. Additionally, the algorithm is flexible and
can be adapted to different bottle crate images with minor adjustments to parameters and thresholds
